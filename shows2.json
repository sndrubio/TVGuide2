Two series were broadcast in 1998 and 1999 on BBC2. The name was a satirical reference to ITV's This Morning which was at the time popularly referred to as This Morning with Richard and Judy.\n\nThe show was a reworking of old material from their previous work together (radio and TV) along with new characters. The show was hosted in a daytime chat show format in front of a live studio audience, although it featured a small proportion of pre-recorded location inserts. It was structured by the often strange obsessions of Richard Herring, examples include his rating of the milk of all creatures and attempting to popularise the acronym of the show (TMWRNJ) (in the style of Tiswas). The show featured (and acknowledged its use of) repetition, with regular and vigilant viewers being rewarded by jokes that would make no sense to casual viewers. The show seemed to oscillate between the intellectual and puerile, however irony was often used, even though the citing of irony as an excuse was mocked by the show's stars in one of many self-referential jokes.","runtime":45,"network":"BBC TWO","air_day":"","air_time":"12:00am","certification":"","imdb_id":"","tvdb_id":78491,"tvrage_id":9889,"ended":true,"images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/6717.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/6717.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/6717.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":77,"votes":3,"loved":3,"hated":0},"genres":[""]},{"title":"The Judy Garland Show","year":1963,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/the-judy-garland-show","first_aired":-197485200,"country":"United States","overview":"\"The Judy Garland Show\" is an American musical variety television series that aired on CBS in the Sunday 9:00 PM EST time-slot during the 1963-1964 television season.

An idealistic lawyer from a working-class background, Deed has got near to the top of his profession by his intellect, his charm, and an obsessive belief in justice. Judge Deed wants to uphold the law (and his own independence) at all costs, and this leaves him at odds with a series of British government stooges who try to influence his decisions.Outside court, Deed is a womanizer who has an up-and-down relationship with fellow barrister Jo Mills (played by Jenny Seagrove), and his glamorous ex-wife Georgina Channing (another barrister, played by Caroline Langrishe) is somehow never quite out of his life. He and Georgina have a daughter called Charlie (Louisa Clein), at first a law student, later a young barrister, whose escapades have a way of getting Deed into hot water. Row Colemore (Christopher Cazenove) is a senior Metropolitan Police officer and one of Deed's oldest friends.","runtime":90,"network":"BBC One","air_day":"","air_time":"12:00am","certification":"","imdb_id":"tt0302128","tvdb_id":79120,"tvrage_id":785,"ended":true,"images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/5876.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/5876.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/5876.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":70,"votes":3,"loved":3,"hated":0},"genres":["Drama"]},{"title":"Alice Nevers, the Judge is a woman","year":2002,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/alice-nevers-the-judge-is-a-woman","first_aired":1030950000,"country":null,"overview":"","runtime":50,"network":"TF1","air_day":"Thursday","air_time":"8:50pm","certification":"","imdb_id":"","tvdb_id":255963,"tvrage_id":0,"ended":false,"images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/27858.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart/27858.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/27858.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":0,"votes":0,"loved":0,"hated":0},"genres":["Action","Adventure"]},{"title":"Judge Mathis","year":1969,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/judge-mathis","first_aired":0,"country":"United States","overview":"","runtime":0,"network":"","air_day":"","air_time":"12:00am","certification":"","imdb_id":"","tvdb_id":265539,"tvrage_id":10936,"ended":false,"images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/21185.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart-dark.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banner.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":100,"votes":1,"loved":1,"hated":0},"genres":[""]},{"title":"A Judge of Honor","year":2004,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/a-judge-of-honor","first_aired":1099900800,"country":null,"overview":"From 1980 to 1993, the story of the pool antimafia, guided by Rocco Chinnici with judges Paolo Borsellino and Giovanni Falcone in a desperate and unfortunate war against the mafia.","runtime":90,"network":"Canale 5","air_day":"","air_time":"12:00am","certification":"","imdb_id":"tt0433614","tvdb_id":248535,"tvrage_id":0,"ended":true,"images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/posters/10782.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart-dark.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/10782.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":100,"votes":1,"loved":1,"hated":0},"genres":["Drama","Mini Series"]},{"title":"Judge","year":1969,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/judge","first_aired":0,"country":null,"overview":"What comes around goes around...even from beyond the grave. Most criminals are only concerned with earthly justice - the laws of man. All too often, the guilty go free, their deeds unpunished. But there is another law. Deep within the spirit world, the wrongful dead seek retribution for the crimes against them by the living. These restless spirits have their own code of justice, and they've chosen the Judge of Darkness and his Demons of Hell to enforce them. An appeal for justice leads to an investigation of a successful, high-ranking corporate executive. Who would believe he'd be involved with embezzlement and murder? But the Judge of Darkness soon discovers that the roots of corruption run deep as he slowly works his way up the corporate pyramid.","runtime":1,"network":"","air_day":"","air_time":"12:00am","certification":"","imdb_id":"","tvdb_id":82966,"tvrage_id":0,"ended":false,"images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/poster-dark.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart-dark.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/14275.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":0,"votes":0,"loved":0,"hated":0},"genres":[""]},{"title":"Judge Joe Brown","year":1998,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/judge-joe-brown","first_aired":904633200,"country":"United States","overview":"Judge Joe Brown, the non-traditional, no-nonsense, no-holds-barred presiding judge of his signature series, the daily, half-hour, syndicated, reality courtroom show JUDGE JOE BROWN, that entered its seventh season on Monday, September 13, 2004.","runtime":0,"network":"","air_day":"","air_time":"12:00am","certification":"","imdb_id":"","tvdb_id":73040,"tvrage_id":4079,"ended":false,"images":{"poster":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/poster-dark.jpg","fanart":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/fanart-dark.jpg","banner":"http://slurm.trakt.us/images/banners/21619.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":0,"votes":0,"loved":0,"hated":0},"genres":[""]}]
